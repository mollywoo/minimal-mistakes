# D1-清晨英语朗读笔记

2016年6月5日

今天第一天开始英语朗读之旅。将每天自己的学习情况记录如下：

1. Listening: listening without the text.
2. Reading: reading the text.
3. Reading aloud: 
4. Imitation:
5. Reapeat 2~3 times.

体会：多练习几遍之后，读起来没有那么拗口了。比较流利地读完。即使每天都要看英文资料，但是很少朗读英文，所以刚开始读的时候，老是舌头打结。

困难：语音输入的时候，容易忘记，跟读需要暂停录音。

今天练习了1.5小时。输入文本花了20分钟左右。


> 第一课的文本如下：

> Learning English is not easy, but it is simple. Learning English is something that anyone can do. Whether you're old or young, shy or outgoing, male or female, tall or short, fat or skinny, you can learn English to become a proficient user of English. **All it takes is commitment and execution.**

> A key shift is to change your mindset from one of "studying English" to one of "practicing English" and "using English". With spoken English, for example, one of the most important concepts to grasp is that the way to improve your spoken English is through practice, and by practice I mean opening your mouth and speaking. You're not going to improve your spoken English just by memorizing vocabulary. You're not going to improve your spoken Englsih just by listening to the radio each morning. You're not going to improve your spoken English just by reading a book about spoken English. You're going to improve your English by opening your mouth and speaking!

> So that's what we're going to do here. Each day I will share an English passage for you to use for practice. I will chose from variety of different sources and styles, but I will choose material that I think has value beyond just English practice. The passages may make you laugh or may make you cry, but mostly I hope that make you think. If you find that one day's material dosen't interest you, please have patience, as the next day's passage might match up better with your interests.

> When using the passages for practice, try to **mix listening, reading, reading aloud and imitation.** If you can do just one of these that's still a start, but if you can combine these four methods of practice you'll get much better results. **Try first listening to the passage without looking at the text, then reading the text, then imitating as you listen to the recording, then reading the text aloud. Then repeat.** We'll talk more about this later.

> Learning English is a journey, and I know your journey started long before today, but I hope that today can be the day you begin the habit of practicing everday, and I hope that this can be a place that helps you to become as proficient in English as you want to be.
